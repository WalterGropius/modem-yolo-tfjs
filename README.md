# Real-time Modem info in the browser with YOLOv7 and TF.JS


This is an online interactive modem installation guide using MindAr and a custom implementation of Yolov7 using Tensorflow.js.
The code runs directly on the browser and the detector was trained on the modem dataset to recognizes up to [17 different classes]
